### Traditional vs. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts., often created by computer programmers through the help of smart contract development tools, are entirely digital and written using programming languages such as C++, Go, Python, Java, Assembly... whatever you want.

This code defines the rules and consequences in the same way that a traditional legal document would, stating the obligations, benefits and penalties which may be due to either party in various circumstances. This code can then be automatically executed by a distributed ledger system.

The smart contract will be executed automatically by the distributed ledger system on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Miners do this.

### What is Solidity & Ethereum Virtual Machine

Statically typed, like JavaScript and C (the variable type will be determined at compile time, not runtime). Contract-specific features include modified (guard) clauses, event notifiers for listeners, and custom global variables. Solidity is compuiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM.

EVM is a programmable blockchain. Instead of having pre-defined operations, like Bitcoin, you can create your own operations. Cryptopcurrency is an example use case of the blockchain.

### How do Smart Contracts work

1. Smart Contract Code - the code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain
2. Smart Legal Contracts - the use of the smart contract code that can be used as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts.

Code is what goes into the Smart Contract. 

#### Distributed Ledger

This is how the smart contract is sent out to everyone in the network. The code is then encrypted and sent out to other computers via a distributed network of ledgers (i.e. Distributed Ledgers). If this is done via public permissionless blockchain such as bitcoin, the contract is sent out similar to the way that a network update of a bitcoin transaction would occur.
