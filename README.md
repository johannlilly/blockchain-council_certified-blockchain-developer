### Traditional vs. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts., often created by computer programmers through the help of smart contract development tools, are entirely digital and written using programming languages such as C++, Go, Python, Java, Assembly... whatever you want.

This code defines the rules and consequences in the same way that a traditional legal document would, stating the obligations, benefits and penalties which may be due to either party in various circumstances. This code can then be automatically executed by a distributed ledger system.

The smart contract will be executed automatically by the distributed ledger system on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Miners do this.

### What is Solidity & Ethereum Virtual Machine

Statically typed, like JavaScript and C (the variable type will be determined at compile time, not runtime). Contract-specific features include modified (guard) clauses, event notifiers for listeners, and custom global variables. Solidity is compuiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM.

EVM is a programmable blockchain. Instead of having pre-defined operations, like Bitcoin, you can create your own operations. Cryptopcurrency is an example use case of the blockchain.

### How do Smart Contracts work

1. Smart Contract Code - the code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain
2. Smart Legal Contracts - the use of the smart contract code that can be used as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts.

Code is what goes into the Smart Contract. 

#### Distributed Ledger

This is how the smart contract is sent out to everyone in the network. The code is then encrypted and sent out to other computers via a distributed network of ledgers (i.e. Distributed Ledgers). If this is done via public permissionless blockchain such as bitcoin, the contract is sent out similar to the way that a network update of a bitcoin transaction would occur. 

### ICO - What is Initial Coin Offering

A cryptocurrency version of an IPO. It is also known as a crowdsale. To use the newly created technology/product/platform, some virtual tokens are required. Tokens represent the cost of using the platform. These tokens are issued during the ICO in exchange of some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

### ICO - How it works

1. Have an idea. Cryptocurrency tokens are required. They represent the cost of transacting on the new platform. They provide the fuel. 
2. The announcement. Explain the problem and how it will be solved. Typically, use a whitepaper.
3. Specify the capital target.
4. Allocate pre-mined tokens (founders, initial investors, crowdsale).
5. Specify the timeline, from announcement to collection to launch.
6. Issue tokens.
7. Sell tokens on exchanges, potentially allow mining.
