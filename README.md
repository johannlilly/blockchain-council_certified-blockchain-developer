### Traditional vs. Smart Contracts

Smart contracts., often created by computer programmers through the help of smart contract development tools, are entirely digital and written using programming languages such as C++, Go, Python, Java, Assembly... whatever you want.

This code defines the rules and consequences in the same way that a traditional legal document would, stating the obligations, benefits and penalties which may be due to either party in various circumstances. This code can then be automatically executed by a distributed ledger system.

The smart contract will be executed automatically by the distributed ledger system on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Miners do this.

### What is Solidity & Ethereum Virtual Machine

Statically typed, like JavaScript and C (the variable type will be determined at compile time, not runtime). Contract-specific features include modified (guard) clauses, event notifiers for listeners, and custom global variables. Solidity is compuiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM.

EVM is a programmable blockchain. Instead of having pre-defined operations, like Bitcoin, you can create your own operations. Cryptopcurrency is an example use case of the blockchain.

### How do Smart Contracts work

1. Smart Contract Code - the code that is stored, verified and executed on a blockchain
2. Smart Legal Contracts - the use of the smart contract code that can be used as a complement, or substitute, for legal contracts.

Code is what goes into the Smart Contract. 

#### Distributed Ledger

This is how the smart contract is sent out to everyone in the network. The code is then encrypted and sent out to other computers via a distributed network of ledgers (i.e. Distributed Ledgers). If this is done via public permissionless blockchain such as bitcoin, the contract is sent out similar to the way that a network update of a bitcoin transaction would occur. 

### ICO - What is Initial Coin Offering

A cryptocurrency version of an IPO. It is also known as a crowdsale. To use the newly created technology/product/platform, some virtual tokens are required. Tokens represent the cost of using the platform. These tokens are issued during the ICO in exchange of some cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.

### ICO - How it works

1. Have an idea. Cryptocurrency tokens are required. They represent the cost of transacting on the new platform. They provide the fuel. 
2. The announcement. Explain the problem and how it will be solved. Typically, use a whitepaper.
3. Specify the capital target.
4. Allocate pre-mined tokens (founders, initial investors, crowdsale).
5. Specify the timeline, from announcement to collection to launch.
6. Issue tokens.
7. Sell tokens on exchanges, potentially allow mining.

### DAO - What is DAO

DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization or Decentralized Democratic Organization. It is sometimes referred to as DAC. It is a Democratic Organization running on Blockcahin. Everything exists in memory running on the servers on the netowrk. All the rules are written in the programming language. It can behave as a private limited or a public limited company if rules are created properly. The related tokens can represent the shares of teh DAO. Token holders, also known as share holders, can vote on the proposals. Shares can be bought or sold in open markets like stock exchanges. Hundreds of things can be done. Transferring shares can transfer ownership just like transferring a token.

Hacking a DAO is like hacking a blockchain. It is difficult. 

### DAO - Structure and How it works

#### Typical organization structure

An organization is the group of people working on a common interest. An organization has the group of shareholders who represent the ownership of the organization in the percentage format. Share holders appoint a Board of Directors who control the major key decision of the organization. Board of Directors appoints the CEO. The rules & regulations f running the organization are generally written in Bylaws or Memorandum or Article, Article of Association. This might be called something else in your country.

The platform where the DAO runs is called a blockchain. Each action or vote is represented by some form of transaction in the Blockchain. Every action must originate from an address. An address can be owned by anyone or anything running the software. Membership may or may not be represented by the DAO token, aka the cryptotoken. Voting can be configured where 1 token = 1 share. Yes or no.

#### Decision making

Each member will have the right to submit the proposal to take certain decisions. These decisions can be, for example:
- Fire the CEO
- Change the CEO
- Hire a vendor for their service
- Hire a lawyer
- Pay certain amount of ether/USD to someone as a salary or bonus
- Issue the sahre to someone because that person/address is adding more value

#### Vote delegation

Voting power can be optionally delegated to someone. This is just like voting by proxy in the real organization. 

#### Fund raising

The DAO can also raise funds through crowd sourced funding. This payment and issuing the shares/token can be done in real time. Shares can be exchanged or sold by the members without any approval from the DAO.
